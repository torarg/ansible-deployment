# ansible-deployment

## Description
ansible-deployment is a cli application for creating, managing and updating
deployment repositories which are seperated from your actual role development repositories.

While having the management of roles in common with ansible-galaxy, ansible-deployment
also aims to assist your workflow over the whole deployment's lifecycle by
supporting plugins called ``inventory_sources`` and ``inventory_writers`` to 
source and persist the deployment inventory from and to different endpoints.


## Features
- creates a ready to use ansible deployment directory from a json definition.
- fetch and update roles from a remote git repository
- generate local inventory from role defaults and inventory plugins
  - source inventory from one or more sources with ``inventory_sources`` 
  - write inventory to one or more destinations with ``inventory_writers``
- supports fernet encryption for deployment repository
- push and pull support for encrypted deployment repository


## Setup
### Requirements
The following software is not part of the python package requirements 
and needs to be installed manually:
- python >= 3.9
- ansible
- git



### Install as python package
ansible-deployment is shipped as a python package and can be installed via pip:

```
$ pip install .
```

## Quick Start


### Creating a deployment.json file
ansible-deployment needs at least a ``deployment.json`` file to initialize
a deployment directory:

```
$ mkdir -p ~/deployments/my_deployment
$ cat <<EOF > deployment.json
{
    "name": "my-deployment",
    "deployment_repo": {
            "url": "_gitea@git.example.org:user/my-deployment.git",
            "reference": "master"
    },
    "roles_repo": {
        "url": "git@github.com:user/ansible-roles.git",
        "reference": "master"
    },
    "roles": [
        "hetzner/autoinstall",
        "linux/unlock_initramfs",
        "common/bootstrap",
        "linux/k3s/master",
        "linux/k3s/node",
        "linux/k3s/ansible_setup",
        "linux/k3s/hetzner_csi_driver",
        "linux/k3s/certmanager",
        "linux/k3s/prometheus",
        "linux/k3s/gitea",
        "linux/k3s/zammad"
    ],
    "inventory_sources": [
        "terraform",
        "vault"
    ],
    "inventory_writers": [
        "vault"
    ]
}
```

Theoretically we could already initialize our deployment at this point, but 
since we defined ``vault`` and ``terraform`` as ``inventory_sources`` we will
need to make sure those are ready to use.

### Configure inventory plugins

#### vault
The vault inventory source is configured via the same environment variables as the
vault cli client:
```
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.1wilson.home:8200
$ export VAULT_TOKEN=someToken
```

### terraform
Currently the terraform inventory source only supports Hetzner Cloud resources,
so we need a terraform state containing such resources to use it as our
inventory source. 
The state file is expected to reside in ``DEPLOYMENT_DIR/terraform.tfstate``


### Initialize deployment
Right now our deployment directory should at least contain the following files:

```
$ ls
deployment.json  terraform.tfstate
```

To initalize the deployment directory we use ansible-deployment's ``init`` command:

```
$ ansible-deployment init
Deployment key written to: /home/mw/Deployments/my_deployment/deployment.key
{   'deployment_dir': {   'path': '/home/mw/Deployments/my_deployment',
                          'roles_src': "RepoConfig(repo='_gitea@git.1wilson.org:mw/ansible-roles.git', "
                                       "branch='master')"},
    'inventory': {},
    'name': 'my_deployment',
    'roles': [   'openbsd_install_from_rescue',
                 'sysupgrade',
                 'bootstrap',
                 'backup',
                 'wireguard',
                 'webserver',
                 'gitea',
                 'firewall',
                 'add_to_icinga2']}
(Re)Initialize Deployment? [y/N]: y
```

Now we have a ready to use deployment directory sourced from terraform.

```
[mw@mw-arch my_deployment]$ ls -la

## Shell Completion
To enable shell completion you need to register a special function depending
on your shell. After following the steps listed below you will need to start
a new shell session to use shell completion.
### Bash
Save shell completion script somewhere:
```
_ANSIBLE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE=bash_source ansible-deployment > ~/.ansible-deployment-complete.bash
```

Source shell completion script in your `.bashrc`:
```
echo ". ~/.foo-bar-complete.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Zsh
Save shell completion script somewhere:
```
_ANSIBLE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE=zsh_source ansible-deployment > ~/.ansible-deployment-complete.zsh
```

Source shell completion script in your `.zshrc`:
```
echo ". ~/.foo-bar-complete.zsh" >> ~/.zshrc
```

### Fish
Save shell completion script:
```
_ANSIBLE_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE=fish_source ansible-deployment > ~/.config/fish/completions/ansible-deployment-complete.fish
```
