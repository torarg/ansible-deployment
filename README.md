# ansible-deployment

## overview

ansible-deployment is a cli application for managing ansible deployments.

It features:

- generating a deployment directory from:
    - an ansible roles git repository
    - an inventory plugin
    - a config file defining roles and inventory plugin
- the deployment directory will include 
    - playbook.yml: a templated playbook including specified roles
    - group_vars/*: containing each role's defaults seperated by group
    - host_vars/* : containing inventory plugin information
    - hosts.yml   : inventory file with host and group assignments
    - .git        : a git repository tracking changes the deployment

The idea of this tool is to enforce structure on ansible role development
and usage. All deployment roles' default variables will be written
as group_vars into the deployment inventory. So ideally ansible roles
used with ansible-deployment have all their variables that reflect
deployment specific configuration declared as such.

Each role will add an inventory group with the same name and will have 
a group called 'ansible-deployment' as their child and all parsed hosts
will be added to this 'ansible-deployment' group.

Currently the only supported inventory plugin is 'terraform' and so far
it only supports the use of 'hcloud' resources since managing those
was my primary use case while writing this application.

## setup

```
pip install .
```

## configuration

ansible-deployment requires a deployment.json configuration file
to be present in the current working directory.

```
$ cd mydeployment/
$ ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 mw  staff   408  6 Sep 23:28 deployment.json
